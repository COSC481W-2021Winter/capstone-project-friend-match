### Personas
**Name:** Randolph “Randy” Johnson

<br/>

**Screening Questions:**
Do you have any friends?
Have you moved to a different city recently?
Are you looking to find others with similar interests?

**Narrative:**
Randolph “Randy” Johnson moved to a new city in late February of 2020, and has lost contact with many of his former friends. While he normally enjoys meeting new people at bars and clubs, the lockdowns in his area have prevented him from intermingling with locals and making new friends.

Once lockdowns are lifted, Randy is looking forward to once again going to movies and other events with his friends, and is looking for ways to meet new people to share those experiences with. While he would perfer physical interactions, he's still willing to give the online-first meetings a chance until it's safe to once again meet in person.

He’s looking for ways to meet new people in his area, but he doesn’t want to use services like Tinder or Bumble, which are geared towards dating rather than friendships. He’s also looking for people who share his interests in crafts, metalworking, and nature. 

**Values:**
Ability to make non romantic connections, matching with people who have common interests as well as different ones, links to a user's other social media accounts
